             ðŸ”¹ Milon Mia â€“ Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer & CSE Student at Dhaka University<br/>
                Milon Mia is a passionate and curious Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student<br/>
                at Dhaka University, deeply interested in building intelligent systems that can make<br/>
                human life easier, faster, and more efficient. With a growing foundation in Machine<br/>
                Learning, Web Development, and Software Engineering, Milon is actively working <br/>
                towards mastering the technologies that drive innovation in todayâ€™s digital world.<br/><br/>
                
                From the beginning of his academic journey, Milon has shown a strong inclination<br/>
                toward understanding how things work under the hoodâ€”from data structures and <br/>
                algorithms to the mathematics behind AI. His current focus is on Machine <br/>
                Learning, where he's exploring core concepts like supervised and unsupervised<br/>
                learning, model evaluation, and neural networks. He plans to build real-world<br/>
                projects that combine both theory and practical application to solidify his understanding.<br/><br/>

                At the same time, heâ€™s learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which he sees<br/>
                as essential to writing clean, modular, and scalable codeâ€”paving the way <br/>
                toward backend development and large-scale software systems.<br/><br/><br/>

                Beyond coursework, Milon is eager to explore open-source contributions,<br/>
                participate in hackathons, and collaborate on academic or freelance<br/>
                tech projects that challenge his skills. He believes in learning by doing,<br/>
                and he often experiments with new frameworks and tools to stay updated in a fast-evolving tech landscape.<br/><br/>
